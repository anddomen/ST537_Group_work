1. Points are overlapping, meaning you cannot tell where clusters are.
```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_jitter()

```
2. width and height

3. geom_count() counts the number of points with the same value and displays them in the same location by scaling the point. geom_jitter() randomly moves each point by a small amount, removing point overlap.

4. Stacking
```{r}
ggplot(mpg)+
  geom_bar(aes(x = class, fill = trans))
